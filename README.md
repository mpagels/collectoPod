This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# collectoPod

React app to handle all of my girlfriends favorite podcasts.

Podcasts are becoming increasingly popular in germany and the really well-known ones are often published on elaborate websites. So it is no longer possible to stop the podcast and listen to it later where you paused, because the players on the websites do not have the feature or if you close the website all progress is lost.

collectoPod scraps rss feeds from my girlfriend's favorite podcasts and makes them available for download so that she can consume the episodes as simply as possible in her audio app of choice.
